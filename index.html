      Lol hi im rose <br>
      contact at yabofthebay@gmail.com

  <h2>Really, hi!</h2>
  <p>
    How'd you get here? <br>
    Yeah, the fact you're here is an actual miracle cause in order for you to be on here I have to have found a way to host the website, and you would have to have found it. <br> <br>
    I have this website up because nobody does it anymore! <br>
    For context it's 2019 as of writing this. <br>
    In the olden days of the internet (which i only got a tiny tiny glimpse of because im like 13), <br>
    Everyone had their own website instead of going to social media. <br>
    Am I saying that Bebo and MySpace ruined the internet? Yes.
    <h3>Boycott Facebook and Twitter</h3>
    <h4>And also you Mastodon weirdos!</h4>
    The solution? Go make a website! Yes, you! <br>
    Also tell your friends! <br> <br>
    Go make a website, put all your stuff on there. <br>
    Doesn't have to be self-hosted, or your own code. Just don't use Wix or Squarespace or anything that makes your website look too modern.
  </p>
  <h2>So what am I gonna put here?</h2>
  <p>I don't know, random images of Animal crossing characters perhaps?</p>
